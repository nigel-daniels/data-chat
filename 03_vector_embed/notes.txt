Embeddings
----------

    Text  -> Split -> Embedding -> [-0.003530, -0.010379, ..., 0.005863]

                                      /
    - Embedding vector captures content/meaning
    - Text with similar content has similar vectors

For Example:
    1) My dog rover likes to chase squirrels.
    2) Fluffy, my cat refuses to eat from a can.
    3) The Chevy Bolt accelerates to 60 mph in 6.7 seconds.
