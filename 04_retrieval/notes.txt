Question     =>    Vector   =>     Relevant     =>  Prompt -> LLM    => Answer
'Query'			   Store			Splits


-   Accessing/indexing the data in the vector store
    - Basic semantic similarity
    - Maximum marginal relevance
    - Including metadata

-   LLM Aided Retrieval


Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)
--------------------------------
-   You may not aways want to choose the most similar responses.

    For example, if a chef asks:
        "tell me about all-white mushrooms with large fruiting bodies"


Vector Store
    a:  The Amanita phalloides has large and imposing epigeous (aboveground)
        fruiting body (basidiocarp).
    b:  A mushroom with a large fruiting body is the Aminata phalloides.
        Some varieties are all-white.
    c:  AA. phalloides, a.k.a Death Cap, is one of the most poisonous of all
        known mushrooms.

    a + b : Most similar

    b + c : MMR

MMR Algorithm
-------------

- Query the vector store
- Choose the 'fetch_k' most similar responses.
- Within those responses choose the 'k' most diverse

    query
      |
      \/
    Vector      Top 'fetch_k'      Most
    Store        responses        diverse
    =======        =======        =======
    =======
    =======   ->   =======   ->
    =======        =======        =======
    =======
      ...
    =======        =======


LLM Aided Retrieval
-------------------
-   There are several situations where the Query applied to the DB is more
    than just the Question asked.
-   One is SelfQuery, where we use an LLM to convert the user question
    into a query.

    question           'What are some movies
                          about aliens made
                              in 1980?'
                                  |
                                  \/
                             Query Parser
                                  |
                                  \/
                        Filter          Search Term
                   eq('year', 1980)       'Aliens'

Compression
-----------
-   Increase the number of results you can put in the context by shrinking the
    responses to only the relevant information.

The trade off is more calls to the LLM in return for more relevant splits
for the final answer.
